        <h1> THE SEASON </h1>

        <p> It has been long awaited by many yet, only a few get to feel it's warmth. <br>
            How sad it is not to be here, now that it is finally here. <br>
            But taking in the warmth of it,allowing it to heal our wounds and taking away the pain and the sorrows, and wiping away the tears. <br>
            Oh, how good it feels when we allow the <em> <b> joy, peace, </em> </b> and <em> <b> love </em> </b> of our <b> LORD </b> to fill our hearts. <br> 
            By doing this good to ourselves, we can then extend a helping hand to others. <br> 
            Filling them with the very joy, peace, and love that is overflowing in our own hearts, that the <b> SAVIOUR </b> has filled us with.<br>
            It's time to embrace the love of <b> JESUS </b>, as HE is being born for us once again. <br>
            Yes, it's the season of joy, peace, and, above all LOVE, for it is the love for mankind that <b> CHRIST </b> was born. <br>

                                                   <br><i> <b> THE SEASON OF LOVE is here again!!! </br></i> <br>
